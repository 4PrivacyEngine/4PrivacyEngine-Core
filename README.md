# 4PrivacyEngine-Core
C++ implementation of the 4PrivacyEngine core

## Open Source Code and White Paper Coming Soon...
The 4PrivacyEngine has been a work in progress since late 2020 - with the specification and conception. The first half of this year was spent in proof-of-concepts and work on the core.  Additional time was spent this year on building and testing bindings for Java, Swift, Dart, and Electron.  A draft of the white paper has been written and is in an internal review phase.

## Roadmap
**Establish an advisory team to review the white paper and code.**  We hope to get academics and industry experts to join us in the effort to improve the white paper and tighten the code.

**Initial advisory team white paper review.**  Rework the white paper based on initial feedback from advisors.

**Initial advisory team code review.** Refactor code based on feedback from advisors.

**Final advisory team white paper review.**  Use final advisor feedback to prepare white paper for public review.

**Second advisory team code review.**  Refactor code based on feedback from advisors in preparation for additional external code review and testing.

**Limited external code review.** Make code available to limited external organizations for testing and review.  This is the final step before putting codes into public repositories.

**Place codes in public repositories.**  Allow public review of code.
