# 4PrivacyEngine-Core
C++ implementation of the 4PrivacyEngine core

## Open Source Code and White Paper Coming Soon...
The 4PrivacyEngine has been a work in progress since late 2020 - with the specification and conception. The first half of this year was spent in proof-of-concepts and work on the core. This year, we spent more time building and testing bindings for Java, Swift, Dart, and Electron. A draft of the white paper has been written and is in an internal review phase.

## Roadmap
**Establish an advisory team to review the whitepaper and code.**  We hope to get academics and industry experts to join us in the effort to improve the whitepaper and tighten the code.

**Initial advisory team whitepaper review.**  Rework the whitepaper based on initial feedback from advisors.

**Initial advisory team code review.** Refactor code based on feedback from advisors.

**Final advisory team whitepaper review.**  Use final advisor feedback to prepare a whitepaper for public review.

**Second advisory team code review.**  Refactor code based on feedback from advisors in preparation for additional external code review and testing.

**Limited external code review.** Make code available to limited external organizations for testing and review. The review is the final step before putting code into a public repository.

**Place code in public repository.**  Allow public review of code.
