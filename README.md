# 4PrivacyEngine-Core
C++ implementation of the 4PrivacyEngine core

## Open Source Code and Whitepaper Coming Soon...
The 4PrivacyEngine has been a work in progress since late 2020 - with the specification and conception. The first half of this year was spent in proof-of-concepts and work on the core.  Additional time was spent this year on building and testing bindings for Java, Swift, Dart, and Electron.  A draft whitepaper has been written and has gone through internal editing and review.

## Roadmap
**Establish an advisorary team to review the whitepaper and code.**  We hope to get acedemics and industry experts to join us in the effort to improve the whitepaper and tighten the code.

**Initial advisorary team whitepaper review.**  Rework the whitepaper based on initial feedback from advisors.

**Initial advisorary team code review.** Refactor code based on feedback from advisors.

**Final advisorary team whitepaper review.**  Use final advisor feedback to prepare whitepaper for public review.

**Second advisorary team code review.**  Refactor code based on feedback from advisors in preparation for additional external code review and testing.

**Limited external code review.** Make code available to limited external organizations for testing and review.  This is the final step before putting code into public repository.

**Place code in public repository.**  Allow public review of code.
